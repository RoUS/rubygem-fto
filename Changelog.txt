1.1.0
	* Added !@R and !@r arbitrary-radix effectors.
	* Moved some of the lambda functions into the Context and Effector
	  classes where they more properly belong.
	* Gave standard effectors UUID values for their IDs, for
	  documentation linking and univerality.  Created empty XHTML
	  files for the categories and effectors, for inclusion in the
	  Effectors.html file.
	* Touched up the site CSS a little.  (Still pretty bogus.)

1.0.0 2009-12-07
	* Added !%T( ... !) effector, which does both date and time and is
	  significantly different from OpenVMS' meaning for !%T and !%D.
	  Oh, well.
	* Added FTO.clearEffectorList() for easy replacement of the
	  standard effectors with a custom set.
	* Made effector processing safe (i.e., the output of one effector
	  can't affect the format string seen by subsequent effectors).
	* Fix a problem with string field width calculation when none was
	  specified.
	* Freeze the class variables when they're rebuilt.

0.1.0 2009-12-03 Initial gem released
--------------------------
	Not a complete implementation of OpenVMS' SYS$FAO system service
	syntax, but probably about 95% of the useful stuff.  (Much of
	SYS$FAO's functionality is specific to the OpenVMS operating
	system.)  The extensibility of FTO is a completely new feature.
